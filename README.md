# My Coding Portfolio

This project is a personal coding portfolio website showcasing the developer's skills, projects, and experience in web development. It provides a platform for the developer to showcase their work, share information about themselves, and connect with potential collaborators or clients.

## Value Proposition
The Coding Portfolio serves as a comprehensive resume in the form of a dynamic, interactive website. It allows users to explore the developer's background, skills, projects, and achievements in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The portfolio not only presents the developer's capability but also demonstrates their creativity, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering high-quality work.

## Features
- **Header and Navigation:** The header section displays the website title and the navigation bar helps users to navigate through different sections of the portfolio.
- **About Me Section:** Provides a brief introduction about the developer, their educational background, and passion for web development.
- **Projects Section:** Showcases the developer's projects with descriptions and links to explore more.
- **Contact Me Section:** Allows visitors to contact the developer for collaboration or inquiries.
- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices.

## Testing Procedures and Findings
- **Navigation Testing:** Checked all navigation links to ensure they lead to the correct sections of the portfolio.
- **Responsiveness Testing:** Tested the portfolio on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it displays correctly and is user-friendly.
- **Form Submission Testing:** Tested the contact form to ensure it captures user input correctly and provides proper feedback upon submission.
- **Browser Compatibility Testing:** Checked the portfolio on multiple browsers to ensure consistent performance.
